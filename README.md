# Rare: The Puplishing Platform for the Discerning Doggo

This is a learning project. Our goals were to practice full stack development by creating a react client and python-django back end.

This project was completed in 3 agile-scrum sprints. 
- Week one, wrote the back end in pure python + sql. That repo can be found here: https://github.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-42/rare-server-news-hounds
- Week two, re-wrote the back end using the django framework (this repo)
- Week three, added more functionality to the site (subscriptions & reactions)

As a team, we decided to implement the react-bootstrap styling library on this project. This allowed us to create a consistent appearance across the site.
